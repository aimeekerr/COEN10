It is close to home
</li>
<p> I was homeschooled until I was in 8th grade so I have always loved being home! </p>
<li>
My older brother is a senior here
</li>
<p> He loves it so it made me think I would too </p>
<li>
The campus is beautiful!
</li>
<p>My favorite time of day here is when the sun goes down but it is not quite dark yet</p>
